## About 

I'm a Computational Social Scientist which, in my case, means I love combining tools from machine learning and the social sciences to understand and improve social outcomes.

I work as a senior data scientist at [Beam](https://bybeam.co), a fully-remote startup working to improve the delivery of digital public services.

I also teach at [Franklin and Marshall College](https://fandm.edu) and am working to complete and defend my dissertation in the Department of Politics at [Princeton University](https://politics.princeton.edu/).
My full CV in pdf format can be found [here](/crisman_cv_2024.pdf).

The views presented on this site are my own and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of my employers.
