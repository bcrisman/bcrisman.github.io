[**POL938: Senior Thesis Poster Session**](https://politics.princeton.edu/senior-thesis-poster-session), Graduate Student Coordinator, Spring 2021

*In order to graduate, Politics seniors must present a professional poster describing their senior thesis research. To prepare students for this event, we provided students with informational sessions, work shops, and one-on-one consultations. While broadly focused scientific communication, these sessions covered issues related to public speaking, data visualization, and user experience (UX).*

Examples discussed include the civil rights, women's and environmental movements; the French, Russian, and Iranian revolutions; the collapse of communism; and the "color revolutions," the Arab Spring, and other waves of revolution in the contemporary world.*

[**POL345: Introduction to Quantitative Social Science**](https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1202&courseid=013781), Preceptor (TA) Ã—2, Fall 2019 

*Would universal health insurance improve the health of the poor? Do patterns of arrests in US cities show evidence of racial profiling? What accounts for who votes and their choice of candidates? This course will teach students how to address these and other social science questions by analyzing quantitative data. The course introduces basic principles of causal inference and programming skills for data analysis. The goal is to provide students with the foundation necessary to analyze data in their own research and to become critical consumers of statistical claims made in the news media, in policy reports, and in academic research.*

[**ExecEd: Global Security, Information Processing, and Leadership**](https://esoc.princeton.edu/projects/executive-education-leading-evidence-based-decisions), Teaching Fellow, Spring 2016

*This course introduces participants to the core analytic principles of information processing. The principles are universally applicable to problems of extracting reliable and accurate conclusions from information and data. Second, we apply these principles to critical global security and conflict challenges. In the course of doing so, participants are also introduced to cutting edge research on security and conflict. Third, we explore leadership strategies to incorporate the information processing principles. The goal is for participants not only to master the principles themselves, but also to develop approaches that will help their home organizations deal with security and conflict information more efficiently and accurately.*
