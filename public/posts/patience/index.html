  <p>Seven. My oldest son is seven and he is on the verge of being genuinely helpful with outdoor chores. A welcome horizon, to be sure, but already seven is the age where kids (my kids at least) make for genuinely great companionship during work.</p>
<p>He and I spent the better part of the afternoon outside today raking leaves and chatting to the neighbors while his brother, five, explored the front yard on his scooter. It was my first proper day off since taking a new job. The leaves were in no particular rush to be done with the task and neither were we.</p>
<p>The slow work made me reflect on some of my earliest memories working outside with my father. I recall holding up a splintery fence rail while my dad fixed it into place. The rail was replacing one that some horse or other had kicked through.</p>
<p>My dad had a very strange work schedule, if you can call it that. A equine veterinarian, he spent weeks at a time traveling from this farm to that all over the country. The upside of this chaotic schedule is that he was also home for days and sometimes weeks at a time in the off-season. This meant he had real time for projects and real, unrushed time for his kids.</p>
<p>He could devote a whole afternoon during the week to taking a long walk along the river. He could devote several days to some poorly planned 8 year old&rsquo;s scheme. He could and he did.</p>
<p>My mother I&rsquo;m sure sees it differently. My siblings and I would gallavant off with our father during adventure times and she would take more than the lion&rsquo;s share of the day-to-day realities of child-rearing. She would make sure we had clothes that fit, were chaffeured to appointments and practice on time, and were fed more than grilled cheese and chocolate cake.</p>
<p>In my own day to day life, I rarely have time for either. I didn&rsquo;t have a clear example of a nine to five job and the associated lifestyle. If I had, I would have taken greater care to avoid it.</p>
<p>And this isn&rsquo;t to say I don&rsquo;t like my job. I genuinely love my job. I work on important and interesting problems with intelligent and kind people.</p>
<p>However, I do wish I had more opportunity for unrushed time with my kids. It isn&rsquo;t about more time, it&rsquo;s about the shape of it. I&rsquo;d work a week straight if I had 5 days off. Or perhaps get off earlier and have more of an opportunity for time at the end of the day to spend with the kids in dedicated pursuits.</p>
<p>This is what I hope the future of work brings. More <em>unrushed</em> time if not more time.</p>
