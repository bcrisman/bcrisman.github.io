  <p>The vast majority of data scientists working in the field right now are likely working on problems that affect and are affected by humans.</p>
<p>Humans are hard.</p>
<p>They make for messy, complicated data from which it can be challenging to draw conclusions.
And these challenges are entirely separate from the technical difficulties of working with data.
Humans also make messy data due to poor database design and bad naming conventions, but those are different stories.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at some key features of <em>homo sapiens</em> in the context of technology. Humans:</p>
<ul>
<li>try to game systems to their advantage.</li>
<li>are easily distracted by phones, other humans, and changes to their environment.</li>
<li>will bristle at being told that they might be distracted by their phones.</li>
<li>will bristle at being told what to do if done too directly.</li>
<li>will <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi_census_phenomenon">choose responses because they are humorous</a> rather than true.</li>
<li>will make random selections on forms to move through them faster.</li>
<li>suffer from myriad cognitive and social biases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Humans are <em>hard</em>.</p>
<p>Computer science and statistics courses, the bread and butter of traditional data science training, often (but not always) miss out on these human considerations. While some nof these examples will show up only in the error term of our estimates others reflect dynamics that can be incredibly important for understanding patterns that are playing out in your data, what these data reflect in the real world, and most importantly, what actions you should take related to those patterns.</p>
<p>As a matter of policy, should the Australian government take action on their estimate of households identifying as members of the Jedi religion? Should they allocate funding to Jedi temples to ensure the local Jedi population has adequate physical places of worship?</p>
<p>If we design an intervention that reduces measured spam to zero, can we say that we&rsquo;ve eliminated spam on our platform?</p>
<p>Any time there is a human anywhere in your data generating process, you are doing social science. Labelers are fallible.</p>
<h2 id="measurement">Measurement</h2>
<h2 id="prediction">Prediction</h2>
<h2 id="inference">Inference</h2>
<p>Incentives
Adverse selection
Moral Hazard
Predictive optimization vs<br>
commons biases in survey design (framing, first question, desireability bias)</p>
<p>This means that any time you have humans somewhere in your data generating process, you are doing social science.</p>
<p>The reason this is worth noting is that even the most technically proficient data scientists often have no social science training.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="example-1">Example 1.</h3>
<p>An insurance policy</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>clear up some misconceptions (what is a social scientist). A computational social scientist is someone who uses computational tools like HPC, ML, simulation, ABM etc to answer social question. That is <em>not</em> what I&rsquo;m talking about here.</li>
<li>Claim: any time a human interacts with your data generating process.</li>
<li>Why this matters: Your policy choices will be wrong. (link to against predictive optimization).</li>
<li>Examples of tools: selection bias, game theoretic considerations, accidental &rsquo;nudges&rsquo;, etc</li>
<li>Solution &ndash; In the same way we have a great &lsquo;missing semester&rsquo; for computer scientists, I really wish there were a missing</li>
</ul>
