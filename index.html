              The reintegration of former members of violent extremist groups is a pressing policy challenge. Governments and policymakers often have to change minds among reticent populations and shift perceived community norms in order to pave the way for peaceful reintegration. How can they do so on a mass scale? Previous research shows that messages from trusted authorities can be effective in creating attitude change and shifting perceptions of social norms. In this study, we test whether messages from religious leaders – trusted authorities in many communities worldwide – can change minds and shift norms around an issue related to conflict resolution: the reintegration of former members of violent extremist groups. Our study takes place in Maiduguri, Nigeria, the birthplace of the violent extremist group Boko Haram. Participants were randomly assigned to listen to either a placebo radio message or to a treatment message from a religious leader emphasizing the importance of forgiveness, announcing the leader’s forgiveness of repentant fighters, and calling on followers to forgive. Participants were then asked about their attitudes, intended behaviors, and perceptions of social norms surrounding the reintegration of an ex-Boko Haram fighter. The religious leader message significantly increased support for reintegration and willingness to interact with the ex-fighter in social, political, and economic life (8 to 11 percentage points). It also made people believe that others in their community were more supportive of reintegration (5 to 9 percentage points). Our findings suggest that trusted authorities can be effective messengers for promoting conflict resolution.

            How do widespread public health crises affect political behavior? This article examines the impact of the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak on political participation in Sierra Leone. In addition to the effects observed following conflict and natural disasters, I present evidence that hardship brought on by the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) substantially decreased participation in civic affairs, measured in self-reported political activity using data from an Afrobarometer survey conducted near the end of the outbreak. To account for selection and endogeneity concerns, I undertake falsification and coefficient stability approaches in addition to controlling for levels of political activity in the 2012 national election. The negative effect seems driven in part by a reduction in trust and perceived performance of traditional institutions and not from an increase in economic insecurity, highlighting the role of external efficacy rather than resource-based mechanisms in mediating the relationship between exposure to the disease and participation.

              Can the legacy of state violence undermine participation in transitional justice services designed to consolidate peace after conflict?
               We argue that, in the aftermath of
              armed fighting, state-perpetrated violence leads to reduced uptake of government reconciliation policies. 
              We leverage spatial and temporal variation in civilian victimization
              by perpetrator and find that in contrast to violence committed by non-state groups, violence carried out 
              by state forces against civilians is associated with lower levels of
              enlistment in Colombia’s state-run victim's registry. We also present survey evidence
              linking victimization to lower levels of trust in the government overall. Together, our
              analyses demonstrate that disaggregating the identity of armed actors can provide significant theoretical
               and empirical advances in our understanding of peacemaking and
              post-conflict reconstruction. In the Colombian case, the legacy of state violence leads
              to the systematic exclusion of certain types of victims from transitional justice and undermines trust 
              in the institutions responsible for building durable pathways to peace.
              Consequently, our findings have implications both for the design of transitional justice
              policies, the study of the legacies of conflict on political and social outcomes, 
              and processes of post-conflict peacebuilding.

              This research aims to establish potential opportunities for policy intervention by asking the following question: 
              if we could predict conflict 5-years out, what would separate the predictable failures from the unexpected successes
               (i.e. places where conflict was expected but did not happen) and what would separate the predictable successes from 
               the unexpected failures (i.e. places where conflict was not expected that experience it). The idea is to move beyond
                standard conflict prediction variables to identify previously-unrecognized opportunities for preventive action within
                 a time-frame sufficiently long for significant action by the UN, World Bank, and other international organizations. 
                 Put differently, our goal is to provide policy recommendations by examining what led to unexpected resilience to 
                 conflict in some countries and what happened in places with low risk based on observable characteristics. Existing
                  studies focus in on a set of states which did become affected by violent conflict without comparing them to a set
                   of peers based on objective and replicable criteria. This study addresses this issue by looking at the set of
                    developing countries at the end of the Cold War, predicting a priori which ones would be most likely to become
                     affected by violent conflict, and identifying surprising successes and surprising failures. Essentially, we use 
                     machine learning to approximate what a country team would do in terms of predicting conflict risk five years 
                     out. This approach allows us to compare states which did become affected by violent conflicts (or remained in 
                     violent conflict) to states which did not (or that emerged from violent conflict). On the basis of careful 
                     comparison between matched cases, we highlight systemic differences and assess potential policies that can 
                     reduce the risk of conflict.

              In 1996, Burkina Faso enacted legislation banning the practice of female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C). Much of the qualitative literature surrounding FGM/C discounts the impact of legal change on what is considered a social/cultural issue. We use data from the Demographic and Health Surveys DHS(VI) in Burkina Faso to test for a discontinuous change in the likelihood of being cut in the year the law was passed. We ﬁnd robust evidence for a substantial drop in hazard rates in 1996 and investigate the heterogeneous impact of the law by region, religion, and ethnicity. Overall, we roughly estimate that over a ten year period the law averted the genital mutilation/cutting of approximately 237,591 women and girls. We qualify our ﬁndings recognizing that Burkina Faso is a special case with a long history of bottom-up and top-down approaches to eliminating the practice.

              Governments buy about $9 trillion worth of goods and services a year, and their procurement policies are increasingly subject to international standards and institutional regulation including the WTO Plurilateral Agreement on Government Procurement, Open Government Partnership commitments and International Financial Institution procurement rules. These standards focus on transparency and open competition as key tools to improve outcomes. While there is some evidence on the impact of competition on prices in government procurement, there is less on the impact of specific procurement rules including transparency on competition or procurement outcomes. Using a database of World Bank financed contracts, we explore the impact of a relatively minor procurement rule governing advertising on competition using regression discontinuity design and matching methods. The rule does appear to have a small, positive impact on bidding levels, suggesting the potential for more significant and strongly enforced transparency initiatives to have a sizeable effect on procurement outcomes.

            &ldquo;Without Ben's precept I would be completely lost in the course. He helped frame 
            the conceptual within the coding and made the connection clear. He patiently answered our questions
            and even stayed beyond time to make sure we understood. He also helped guide our questions to

            everyone was involved in precept. He also went above and beyond his duties as my preceptors by sitting
            down with me during office hours and going over how to do my JP - I really, really appreciated that and

            &ldquo;Easily one of the best preceptors I have had at Princeton. Went above and beyond and devoted his
            time to help students understand the material and create meaningful discussions. He connected the material
            from lecture with the assigned readings which was very helpful.&rdquo;

      <p>
        In order to graduate, Politics seniors must present a professional poster describing
        their senior thesis research. To prepare students for this event, we provided students
        with informational sessions, work shops, and one-on-one consultations. While broadly focused
        scientific communication, these sessions covered issues related to public speaking, data visualization,
        and user experience (UX).

      <p>This course investigates the politics of protest and revolution, examining the conditions under which protest movements emerge, their choice of tactics, the effects of repression and concessions, and the determinants of movement success. The second part of the course focuses on revolutions, examining the forms they assume and the conditions under which they develop and prove successful. Examples discussed include the civil rights, women's and environmental movements; the French, Russian, and Iranian revolutions; the collapse of communism; and the "color revolutions," the Arab Spring, and other waves of revolution in the contemporary world.

      <p>Would universal health insurance improve the health of the poor? Do patterns of arrests in US cities show evidence of racial profiling? What accounts for who votes and their choice of candidates? This course will teach students how to address these and other social science questions by analyzing quantitative data. The course introduces basic principles of causal inference and programming skills for data analysis. The goal is to provide students with the foundation necessary to analyze data in their own research and to become critical consumers of statistical claims made in the news media, in policy reports, and in academic research.

      <p> This course introduces participants to the core
        analytic principles of information processing. The principles are universally applicable to
        problems of extracting reliable and accurate conclusions from information and data.
        Second, we apply these principles to critical global security and conflict challenges. In
        the course of doing so, participants are also introduced to cutting edge research on
        security and conflict. Third, we explore leadership strategies to incorporate the
        information processing principles. The goal is for participants not only to master the
        principles themselves, but also to develop approaches that will help their home
        organizations deal with security and conflict information more efficiently and accurately.
